[Neucoin](http://neucoin.org/) (abbreviated NEU) aims to be the leading [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) focused on using a [proof-of-stake consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) (first introduced by [Peercoin](https://github.com/ppcoin/ppcoin)) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Neucoin is based on [Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/), itself based on [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), while introducing many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.

# Usage

Please check the [doc](https://github.com/neucoin/neucoin/blob/master/doc/) directory for more information, including how to compile the client.

# Repo Guidelines

  * Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
  * If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
  * If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion on [our forums](http://forum.neucoin.org/) for a broader community discussion.
  * The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
  * From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable, a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
  * No pull request will be merged as long as it breaks the functional tests (Travis will run on every pull request).

# Compiling

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) is required to build Neucoin binary and tests.

Here is an example on how-to compile with defaults options:

 > #Place yourself in the basedir
 > $ cmake src
 > $ make
